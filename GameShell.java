 * Implementing:
 * Functional floors
 * A JFrame graphical display
 * A controllable player
 * Separate classes for different entities
 * Separated floor and room contents, so things can move around on an unchanging floor.
 * Console controls for the player.
 * Characters for representing the floor, objects, and mobs.
 * A data structure that is expansible and flexible for holding objects at coordinates.
 * Multiple move commands can be given at once.
 * Mobile enemy units.
 * Random enemy movement.
 * Separate loops for console input and actual game turns.
 * Keyboard controls for movement.
 * Locked frame size.
 * Dynamically-sized frame.
 * Entity health or integrity.
 * Ostensibly destructible furniture.
 * A consistent style throughout the code.
 * Full documentation.
 * Methods marked for which static variables they access.
 * Methods physically organized by their role in the program.
 * Generalized entity-spawning code.
 * Naive support for entity removal.
 * Input blocking while turn is in progress.
 * Naive prevention of input buffering.
 * Superior support for entity removal and array cleaning.
 * Boolean line-of-sight.
 * Superior boolean line-of-sight -- realistic. No range.
 * Integrated line-of-sight with the display to reflect it. (No optimization)

     * This may not be the best design -- it's intended to allow dynamic expansion
